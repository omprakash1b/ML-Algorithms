ðŸ§  ML-Algorithms

A collection of Machine Learning algorithms implemented from scratch using Python and NumPy â€” no scikit-learn shortcuts!
This repository is meant for learning and understanding how ML algorithms work internally by building them step by step.

ðŸ“Œ Features

Classic ML Algorithms implemented from scratch:

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Logistic Regression

Linear Regression

Easy-to-read, modular code for each algorithm.

Includes accuracy calculation and result visualization (where applicable).
